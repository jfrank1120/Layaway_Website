      <p class="info_area">
        Layaway began as a group of friends who started an iMessage group chat
        freshman year of high school in 2012. However, almost 10 years later
        that group of 4 friends (now known as the founding fathers) has
        transformed the groupchat into one of a kind. Spawning several offchute
        chats such as the Wall Street investment chat, the Sports Betting Chat,
        the Fantasy Sports Chat, and many more. The groupchat has become a home
        to a group of friends who have experienced so much together during these
        times. From figuring out high school, to going off to college, to
        graduating, to a global pandemic, Layaway has stayed strong through it
        all no matter the circumstances and hopes to continue that trend into
        the future.
