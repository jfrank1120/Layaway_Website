Welcome to Layaway

My Project

### What is "Layaway"?

Layaway is a iMessage groupchat name that my friends from high school use to denote our friendgroup and all of the antics we are involved in.
I decided to make this website since in high school my friends always said it would be cool to keep track of the chat.

### HTML Elements

The elements that I chose to include in this website include
* Table
* Images
* In-Line Divs

### JavaScript Functionality

In terms of the JavaScript that I wrote for the site, here is the functionality of it
* Allows for the user to "sign in" to access another page that cannot be accessed without a password
* Show or Hide the different groupings of members or founders on the members page


### Note - The Password on the main page is 'gag'
